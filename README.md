# Bookstor.

Bookstor. is a platform that solves the problem of limited access to affordable books by providing a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can buy, sell, lend, and borrow books while rating each other for trust and reliability. Unlike traditional book marketplaces, Bookstor integrates both centralized and decentralized features, allowing users to log in, interact, and trade books through a standard web application while also supporting cryptocurrency payments via Ethereum wallets for those who prefer decentralized transactions. This dual approach ensures greater flexibility, security, and transparency in book trading while making books more accessible to a wider audience.

The following video presents some of the main functionalities of the website:
